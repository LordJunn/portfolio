# How to use R

This article is mostly to explain what I've learn from the course Statistical Data Analysis (CDS6224) regarding R studio.

## Commands

### R Commands
Let's assume x, y, z as our variables.
`x <- c(number1, number2, number3 ... numberN)`: stores values into variable, outputs as `num[1:N] number1, number2 ... numberN`.
`func(x)`: using a function to do x, includes commands such as `mean`, `sd` & `median`.
`y <- func(x)`: stores the output of `func(x)` & stores into `y`.

### Non R Commands
`CTRL + L`: Clears the screen
