# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and static site generation. It's designed to make building React applications easier and more efficient.

## Why Choose Next.js?

There are several reasons why Next.js has become a popular choice for React developers:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js can render your pages on the server, which improves performance and SEO.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: You can pre-render pages at build time, resulting in fast page loads.
- **API Routes**: Next.js allows you to create API endpoints as part of your application.
- **File-based Routing**: The framework uses a file-based routing system that's intuitive and easy to use.
- **Built-in CSS Support**: Next.js has built-in support for CSS modules, Sass, and other styling options.
